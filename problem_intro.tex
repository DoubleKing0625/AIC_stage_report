\chapter{Presentation of the context of the task}
\label{sec:intro}
In this chapter, several brief presentations will be given to explain the context of the human pose estimation and describe the COCO dataset.

\section{Presentation of Human Pose Estimation}
\label{sec:isauriam}
Localizing body parts for human body is a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision, and it serves as an important basis for high-level vision tasks, e.g., activity
recognition\cite{yang2010recognizing, wang2013approach}, human re-identification\cite{zheng2017pose}, and human-computer interaction.
In generalï¼Œa human pose estimation model aims to predict the 2D coordinates of different human parts given a 2D human image.
Achieving accurate localization, however, is difficult due to the highly articulated human body limbs, occlusion, change of viewpoint, and foreshortening.
Nowadays there exists two main topics in human pose estimation: single person pose estimation and multi-person pose estimation. Obviously, multi-person is more challenging than single person pose estimaion.
But single person is the fundamentation for multi-person pose estimation.
