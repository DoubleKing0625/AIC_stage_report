\chapter{Acknowledgement}

At the end of everthing, I would like to point out that i couldn't finish this internship
successfully without someones, and here I give my most sincere thanks to them.

Firstly, I will express thanks to Gang YU, my team leader. It's him
that taught me the detailed knowledge of computer vision and deep learing, like how to design a network , how to write the code using framework, how to train a model, etc.
He also explained papers to me clearly and carefully.
In fact, he leads me into the deep of CV\&DL domain.

Next, I would like to thank for Zhicheng WANG, my virtual team leader.
During all the COCO competition, he gave me lots of help, like correcting my wrong opinions and reviewing my codes.
We argued about the experiment results and make the plan together.
These experience have brought me tremendous progress.

Finally but with same importance, my colleagues helped me a lot when I encountered
some problems about software or hardware, I will always appreciate that.
